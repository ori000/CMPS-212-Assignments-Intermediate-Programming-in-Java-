/*VERY IMPORANT:

First begin by clicking the SaveAs button so you create a new file other wise you will get an error when Saving since no file exists.
To Load, first you have to open the file that you want, then load its content. Otherwise you will get an error since Java doesn't know
what file to load since we have not specified anything yet.

Those errors prove the logic behind this code and are not bugs in my code.
